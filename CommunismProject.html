<p style="color: red;">With only five communist countries remaining in the world today, the current leaders of these countries have taken control of the economy and executive powers within their respective countries. These "communist" countries have been conquered by malicious generals who have forcefully assumed power, converting these countries into what is known as a command economy.</p>
